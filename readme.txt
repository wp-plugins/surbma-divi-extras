Useful modifications for the Divi Theme.

== Description ==

This plugin fixes and adds some useful modifications to the Divi Theme by Elegant Themes. This is a very lightweight plugin with minified css to reduce the loading time as low as possible.

Surbma - Divi Extras plugin features:

- Fixes some Divi styling.
- Removes ugly list icons in the footer.
- Adds extra classes for Page Builder Sections: small-space, no-space
- Hide comment allowed tags block.
- Featured menu style, as seen here in the menu: [Monarch plugin demo](http://elegantthemes.com/preview/Monarch/)

= Extra classes for Page Builder Sections =

**small-space**
If you add this class to a Section's CSS Class field, the top and bottom padding will be reduced to 20 px.

**no-space**
If you add this class to a Section's CSS Class field, the top and bottom padding will be reduced to 0 px.

= Extra classes for the Menu items =

**featured-menu**
If you want to have a menu item with a colored background, that really shines in your menu bar, just add this class to your menu item. The best part of it is, that the background color will be the same, what you have set as the Accent Color in the Customizer. Wow!
