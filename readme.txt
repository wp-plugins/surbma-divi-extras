Useful modifications for the Divi Theme.

== Description ==

__IMPORTANT!__ I have created a separate plugin for Gravity Forms styling and I have moved every other customization in a child theme. This lets me do more customization and fixes for the Divi Theme itself.

- You can find my new plugin here: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/surbma-divi-gravity-forms/" target="_blank">Surbma - Divi & Gravity Forms »</a>
- You can find my new child theme here: <a href="https://github.com/Surbma/Divi-Extra" target="_blank">Divi Extra »</a>

If you want to use the plugin + child theme combo, than you have to deactivate and remove the Surbma - Divi Extras plugin. I strongly recommend to use the plugin + child theme combo instead of this plugin, because I won't continue the development of this plugin and this solution is much more powerful.

Also you don't have to use both. If you need only a solution for your Gravity Forms to look pretty in your Divi theme, than my new plugin is perfect for you. If you don't use Gravity Forms, but want to take adventage of my Divi customizations and fixes, than the child theme will do the job for you.

Every discussion about the child theme should be done on the Git website, where you can ask, suggest and help to make it better.
